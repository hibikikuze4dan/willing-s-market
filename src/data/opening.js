  description: [
    "You didn’t expect anything eventful to happen today. It was just a typical day, somewhat boring and monotonous, which ended with you crawling into your bed exhausted. A lingering feeling of loneliness crept upon you as the night went on and you found yourself unable to fall asleep. It would be nice to have some company…",
    "Before you could fully finish that thought, your restlessness finally seemed to end as your eyelids grew heavier. Though as you are about to drift of into the sweet embrace of sleep, you notice a small but all the more searing white light…",
    "Followed by the sensation of smashing through a brick wall.",
    "It all happened in an instant and was to your surprise painless, but the whiplash left you dazed as you found yourself… in the middle of a marketplace, alongside many other man and woman. This small group of strangers appeared to be as confused as you felt.",
    "Then a man clad in luxurious silk and giving of an aura of… hard to describe but the most fitting way would be ‘gentle superiority’, approached you and you could feel yourself mysteriously drawn to him.",
    "“Hello there my friend! Please come with me.”",
    "Just as these words left his mouth, he grasped your hand and pulled you away from the crowd. You glanced back and saw the other people from before in a similar situation, being led away by several other figures, seeming similar to the gentleman that choose you for some reason.",
    "While trying to keep up with this mysterious man, you find your eyes wandering and take in your surroundings. It seemed as if wherever you were looked like an Oriental Bazar of sorts. However, to your shock you weren’t surrounded by jewellery, carpets or spices. Instead, the only ‘wares’ appeared to be… slaves in shackles! Oddly these chained and naked figures gave you several seductive grins and eager looks which made you rather suspicious.",
    "Before you can fully process this you find yourself seated on a pillow in a gilded tent, your favourite drink in hand… how did that get there?",
    "“Please make yourself comfortable.”",
    "The mysterious figure told you as you got your first real chance to look at him. He was a rather handsome one you had to admit, with hard muscles and pink hair that stood out, even if he wouldn’t have these markings on his body. His clothing had been thrown away as he entered, seemingly being restrictive for him as leaned back into a pillow and turned his full attention to you.",
    "Alright. Sorry for the haste just now but we would like to get this over with as quickly and smoothly as possible. Welcome to the Willing Slave Market! Now my name is…",
    "…Wait… why are you looking so horrified? I said WILLING.",
    "Ooookay give me a second I explain to you real quick what’s going on here.",
    "See my name is Libis. I am a minor God of sexual desire. My colleagues are also divine entities of similar backgrounds. We all come from the same localized Verse and met up for companionship and to not be so alone in this vast Verse. What? Even Gods like companionship.",
    "Well, what follows next is kinda a long story but to make it short, we happened to come across a God of Creation in our home universe. He was not much stronger than any of us, but he had plans of conquest and tried to create a species of super soldiers to serve as his lackeys in a siege on a Planet that refused to worship him. Now we decided to not let some asshat try and conquer a whole World that didn’t want to deal with his bullshit, pardon my language, so we went and teamed up on him and destroyed him. He wasn’t truly immortal, at least to not as strong degrees that he could come back, so that was one thing taken care of. However, while said deity is now dealt with… we still have their creation. Those were the ‘Servus’ or ‘Servusi’ in plural.",
    "They are a literal semblance of potential life matter that is conscious, sentient and born with mature mentality. They don’t even look like anything alive yet, they are only orbs of light the size of a football.",
    "They want nothing more than to serve. I mean they NEED to serve. Literally. They are an incredible submissive species that take great joy in following and obeying a Master. For them it is like a purpose of life. To be of use and enjoy the pleasure of servitude.",
    "And we… kinda killed their Master. Oops.",
    "At least we did that before the thousands of them could ‘imprint’ on him and see him as their Master. However, there is still the fact that we got a whole species with these kinds of desires and we felt obligated to help them out.",
    "So, for now we have decided to make US their masters however this can’t really be a permanent solution. There is a practical infinite amount of them, as the thing that ‘births’ them is a raw hole in space time that spits out thousands of them per year. Let alone that this is still merely a non- permanent solution, and everyone knows that, them as well. There is no ‘personal’ connection.",
    "So, in an infinite Multiverse how do you deal with what is basically the ideal willing slave race? Well simple. We let them fulfill their purpose.",
    "This is how this project came to be. Welcome to the Willing Slave Market, or also the Servusi Market. We are an organization that decided to ensure these poor Slaves with no Master or Mistress to call their own get one by delivering them as servants to beings across the Multiverse. Be they Gods or mortals like you.",
    "You and the other people from before were picked at random so congratulations!",
    "Well, we DID consider other factors than random chance of course. Like overall mental state, if you have some good Karma to spend and so on. We’re not just giving them to some abusive asshole or serial killer or something. I actually choose you myself! You seemed like you could use some extra company and you deserved it in my book. But enough of the method of choosing…",
    "So what do you say? Want to take some of them with you?",
    "...",
    "You do? OKAY! Great thanks a lot you’re doing us a favour here.",
    "Now let’s get too business.",
