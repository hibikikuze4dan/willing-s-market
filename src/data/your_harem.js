    "Libis snaps his fingers and several orbs of energy appear before you. They surround you like moths do a bright light and you can feel the excitement emitting from them.",
    "While we have plenty of Servusi to go around, out of experience I can tell you that too many Waifu or Husbando can be a lot to deal with all at once. As such we made a certain ‘limit’. You get to choose any number from 1 to 10 Servus Sparks. This are the minimum and maximum number of Sparks you can receive so its ultimately up to you how big you want your Harem to be. These Sparks you will than form into your future Harem. Don’t worry its easy trust me, and they will be happy as long as you are happy.",
    "As stated, you can assign them any form you wish, be it after a fictional character, one you completely made up, or even a real character. In the latter case don’t worry it will not be weird and their minor psychic influence will guarantee that two of the same looking people won’t make it difficult in any way.",
