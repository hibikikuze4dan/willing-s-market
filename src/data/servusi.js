    "Some more explanation about what a Servus is.",
    "A Servus is filled with love and adoration for their Master. They are unbreakably loyal and in love to them till the very end and give of a passive aura of love that makes their Master also feel happiness when doing something with them, but not in a way which makes the emotion lessen in long term. They want to be their Masters perfect Servant/Lover/etc. While the relationship between you and your Servusi is dependent on you no matter what form it takes they will be the perfect fit for it. For example: any and all kinks you happen to have are their own in a complimentary way. If you’re a Dom their a Sub, if you’re a Sub their a Dom and as a Switch their also Switches for example. This even counts for your actual sex drive, or lack thereof if you happen to be asexual.",
    "By nature, Servusi don’t really have a concept of sexuality as mortals do. They simply love their Master and their fellow Servus. I guess you could call them pansexual but it wouldn’t quite fit. There will be in Harem relationships if you have no issue with that though you will always be their ‘nexus’ basically.",
    "They aren’t completely immortal but have eternal youth, don’t need sustenance and are immune to disease as well as all having a healing factor strong enough to regenerate limbs in a day. Their mental and physical age is never younger than 18 years old, from the moment they pop into existence. They are soul bonded to their Master and will only die when you do. Should they die of violence for some reason they will ‘respawn’ after a day by taxing your Soul. Don’t worry your Soul will be fine and regenerate but you’ll feel tired for a few hours, proportional to however many Servusi revived. After YOU die, they will follow you into whatever afterlife you happen to go to.",
    "They all have a passive psychic effect which works in your and their favour in terms of ‘acceptance’. What this means is that no one will mind it or find your relationship with them odd. Not any family members, friends, strangers, not even any romantic partners you happen to have. In fact, a romantic non Servus partner could be seen by them as a ‘second Master’ and they will strive to serve them as well. This field even works in terms of acceptance of sexuality, so if you are a guy and your Servusi Harem is filled with other guys even the most extreme homophobe wouldn’t bat an eye at your relationship with any of them for example. However, it doesn’t actually cover sexual acts so you would still be fined in public if you do anything sexual with them inside a filled Mall for example. Furthermore, should they look ‘non-human’ like a Twi’lek or have Cat ears this will also be hidden by their psychic effect.",
    "Additionally, their psychic effect allows them empathy and to know what you’re feeling and act accordingly. For example, to comfort you when you’re feeling sad. In general, they strife to always support you. Whether that is relaxing after a long day at work or being a wing man/wing woman.",
    "As mentioned, a Servus starts as a mere Spark of possible life but this Spark can take the form of a being designated to them by their Master. Just to get this cleared out. A Servus can only manifest and change their form ONCE. After this they will be in this form forever. This form can be whatever gender you prefer, be it female, male, or something different like nonbinary or a girl with male testicles to give two examples.",
    "If you happen to make them become a ‘fictional’ character of some sort they will also become them in all personality, biological and all else, but any powers they have are not present. We sealed this aspect about them away to ensure there will be no actual wars due to them.",
    "You can also choose to ‘alter’ some things about a character your Servus is supposed to take inspiration from. For example, an gender bent version of the original or some other slight alterations.",
    "They have an interesting way of reproduction. Namely they can reproduce asexually and ‘will’ themselves into being pregnant. This pregnancy is independent of gender and even a male could birth another Servus. This will occur like a human pregnancy but will be guaranteed to be safe. They can give birth this way only once a year. They can however decide how long the pregnancy is, from a week to a full year. The timespan doesn’t actually affect the growing Servus in any way. They will than birth one Servus Spark which will abide by all the same rules the other Servusi do.",
    "They can also ‘impregnate’ someone if the receiving party consents. This will give them the same kind of ‘Servus’ pregnancy but the resulting child can be decided by the parent who gives the birth to be either the same species as them or a Servus as well. No hybrids are possible.",
    "Servusi by nature possess divine essence as a creation of raw energy by their creator. However, they themselves are neither gods or mortals. They are more akin to demi-demigods in terms of how much divine power is present in them. This doesn’t have any actual effect on you and really only explains the nature of their abilities. However, they ARE pretty popular by Gods who like being worshipped. We have a… let’s say ‘contract’ with a certain city of Gods who steadily take some poor Servusi of our hands. Don’t worry I can assure you every Servusi that leaves this market enjoys their existence.",
    "PHEW! Okay that should be about everything in terms of Servusi characteristics. Sorry about that info dump. Now let’s get into making them okay?",
