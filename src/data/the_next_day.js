    "You wake up in your bed, feeling well rested and your mind free. A sense of relaxation and comfort washes over you. A small smile creeps on your face. You feel happy for some reason.",
    "You remember your dream and Libis. What a weird-.",
    "You don’t finish the thought as you look around your room. The realisation sets in that it WASN’T a dream as your gaze focuses on the Servus/Servusi around you, happily sleeping away as they cuddle next to you.",
    "You need to take a moment to process that, but eventually you just choose to lay back down, enjoying the moment a bit longer. Looks like you weren’t going to be lonely for a long time.",
    "As you do you notice a small strip of paper next to your bed:",
    "HEY! Its me again Libis. Sorry but I forgot to ask you for some information. I am currently doing a Survey in terms of who we give away. Please if you have the time, write down what your Harem looks like and who is in it. Names, eventual differences and all, as well what you and them will be up too. (Basically a way of trying to make your ‘Build’ included in the CYOA somehow. Feel free to Post your Build and ‘plans’ if you have any.)",
    "Don’t worry about sending it. This paper will be mailed to me the moment you are finished, replaced by a Cookie.",
    "Thanks a lot for taking the Services of the Willing Slave Market!",
    "Best Wishes,",
    "Libis.",
