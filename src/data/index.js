These Outfits are self-cleaning and repairing and will always find their way back to its owner. You also get one for yourself. Furthermore, they have the interesting property of making their owner a perfect function for whatever the Outfit is like. For example, if the Outfit is a Maid Dress they will become a top class maid and if it is a Nurse outfit they will become a great Doctor. You can at any time choose how they look and how ‘Kinky’ they are. So, if one is at work they can look like a professional Pilot but in the Bedroom be a sexy Stewardess.",

This is a mutation of sorts and these Servusi are not imprinting on someone but instead see all of reality as their Master. In these cases, we thought the best way to deal with them is by indulging them in their desire to be free use. They are ‘displayed’ in a separate part of the Market, you probably saw them on our way here, and purchasing a Ticket allows you access. A large Bazar full of thousands of attractive man and woman eager to please whoever comes their way. Sounds intriguing? They won’t be your personal Servus but could be pretty fun either way. You can access this Bazar simply by tearing this Ticket apart and passing through a small portal in front of you. You are granted access for 3 hours and time won’t pass here at the end of which you will leave. You can choose to take others with you and a new Ticket will be at your side in one week. We need to manage the flow of customers somehow. Still makes for a fun weekend activity.",
