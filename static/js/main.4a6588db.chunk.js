It was just a typical day, somewhat boring and monotonous, which ended with you crawling into your bed exhausted. A lingering feeling of loneliness crept upon you as the night went on and you found yourself unable to fall asleep. It would be nice to have some company\u2026","Before you could fully finish that thought, your restlessness finally seemed to end as your eyelids grew heavier. Though as you are about to drift of into the sweet embrace of sleep, you notice a small but all the more searing white light\u2026","Followed by the sensation of smashing through a brick wall.","It all happened in an instant and was to your surprise painless, but the whiplash left you dazed as you found yourself\u2026 in the middle of a marketplace, alongside many other man and woman. This small group of strangers appeared to be as confused as you felt.","Then a man clad in luxurious silk and giving of an aura of\u2026 hard to describe but the most fitting way would be \u2018gentle superiority\u2019, approached you and you could feel yourself mysteriously drawn to him.","\u201cHello there my friend! Please come with me.\u201d","Just as these words left his mouth, he grasped your hand and pulled you away from the crowd. You glanced back and saw the other people from before in a similar situation, being led away by several other figures, seeming similar to the gentleman that choose you for some reason.","While trying to keep up with this mysterious man, you find your eyes wandering and take in your surroundings. It seemed as if wherever you were looked like an Oriental Bazar of sorts. However, to your shock you weren\u2019t surrounded by jewellery, carpets or spices. Instead, the only \u2018wares\u2019 appeared to be\u2026 slaves in shackles! Oddly these chained and naked figures gave you several seductive grins and eager looks which made you rather suspicious.","Before you can fully process this you find yourself seated on a pillow in a gilded tent, your favourite drink in hand\u2026 how did that get there?","\u201cPlease make yourself comfortable.\u201d","The mysterious figure told you as you got your first real chance to look at him. He was a rather handsome one you had to admit, with hard muscles and pink hair that stood out, even if he wouldn\u2019t have these markings on his body. His clothing had been thrown away as he entered, seemingly being restrictive for him as leaned back into a pillow and turned his full attention to you.","Alright. Sorry for the haste just now but we would like to get this over with as quickly and smoothly as possible. Welcome to the Willing Slave Market! Now my name is\u2026","\u2026Wait\u2026 why are you looking so horrified? I said WILLING.","Ooookay give me a second I explain to you real quick what\u2019s going on here.","See my name is Libis. I am a minor God of sexual desire. My colleagues are also divine entities of similar backgrounds. We all come from the same localized Verse and met up for companionship and to not be so alone in this vast Verse. What? Even Gods like companionship.","Well, what follows next is kinda a long story but to make it short, we happened to come across a God of Creation in our home universe. He was not much stronger than any of us, but he had plans of conquest and tried to create a species of super soldiers to serve as his lackeys in a siege on a Planet that refused to worship him. Now we decided to not let some asshat try and conquer a whole World that didn\u2019t want to deal with his bullshit, pardon my language, so we went and teamed up on him and destroyed him. He wasn\u2019t truly immortal, at least to not as strong degrees that he could come back, so that was one thing taken care of. However, while said deity is now dealt with\u2026 we still have their creation. Those were the \u2018Servus\u2019 or \u2018Servusi\u2019 in plural.","They are a literal semblance of potential life matter that is conscious, sentient and born with mature mentality. They don\u2019t even look like anything alive yet, they are only orbs of light the size of a football.","They want nothing more than to serve. I mean they NEED to serve. Literally. They are an incredible submissive species that take great joy in following and obeying a Master. For them it is like a purpose of life. To be of use and enjoy the pleasure of servitude.","And we\u2026 kinda killed their Master. Oops.","At least we did that before the thousands of them could \u2018imprint\u2019 on him and see him as their Master. However, there is still the fact that we got a whole species with these kinds of desires and we felt obligated to help them out.","So, for now we have decided to make US their masters however this can\u2019t really be a permanent solution. There is a practical infinite amount of them, as the thing that \u2018births\u2019 them is a raw hole in space time that spits out thousands of them per year. Let alone that this is still merely a non- permanent solution, and everyone knows that, them as well. There is no \u2018personal\u2019 connection.","So, in an infinite Multiverse how do you deal with what is basically the ideal willing slave race? Well simple. We let them fulfill their purpose.","This is how this project came to be. Welcome to the Willing Slave Market, or also the Servusi Market. We are an organization that decided to ensure these poor Slaves with no Master or Mistress to call their own get one by delivering them as servants to beings across the Multiverse. Be they Gods or mortals like you.","You and the other people from before were picked at random so congratulations!","Well, we DID consider other factors than random chance of course. Like overall mental state, if you have some good Karma to spend and so on. We\u2019re not just giving them to some abusive asshole or serial killer or something. I actually choose you myself! You seemed like you could use some extra company and you deserved it in my book. But enough of the method of choosing\u2026","So what do you say? Want to take some of them with you?","...","You do? OKAY! Great thanks a lot you\u2019re doing us a favour here.","Now let\u2019s get too business."]},servusi:{title:"Servusi",description:["Some more explanation about what a Servus is.","A Servus is filled with love and adoration for their Master. They are unbreakably loyal and in love to them till the very end and give of a passive aura of love that makes their Master also feel happiness when doing something with them, but not in a way which makes the emotion lessen in long term. They want to be their Masters perfect Servant/Lover/etc. While the relationship between you and your Servusi is dependent on you no matter what form it takes they will be the perfect fit for it. For example: any and all kinks you happen to have are their own in a complimentary way. If you\u2019re a Dom their a Sub, if you\u2019re a Sub their a Dom and as a Switch their also Switches for example. This even counts for your actual sex drive, or lack thereof if you happen to be asexual.","By nature, Servusi don\u2019t really have a concept of sexuality as mortals do. They simply love their Master and their fellow Servus. I guess you could call them pansexual but it wouldn\u2019t quite fit. There will be in Harem relationships if you have no issue with that though you will always be their \u2018nexus\u2019 basically.","They aren\u2019t completely immortal but have eternal youth, don\u2019t need sustenance and are immune to disease as well as all having a healing factor strong enough to regenerate limbs in a day. Their mental and physical age is never younger than 18 years old, from the moment they pop into existence. They are soul bonded to their Master and will only die when you do. Should they die of violence for some reason they will \u2018respawn\u2019 after a day by taxing your Soul. Don\u2019t worry your Soul will be fine and regenerate but you\u2019ll feel tired for a few hours, proportional to however many Servusi revived. After YOU die, they will follow you into whatever afterlife you happen to go to.","They all have a passive psychic effect which works in your and their favour in terms of \u2018acceptance\u2019. What this means is that no one will mind it or find your relationship with them odd. Not any family members, friends, strangers, not even any romantic partners you happen to have. In fact, a romantic non Servus partner could be seen by them as a \u2018second Master\u2019 and they will strive to serve them as well. This field even works in terms of acceptance of sexuality, so if you are a guy and your Servusi Harem is filled with other guys even the most extreme homophobe wouldn\u2019t bat an eye at your relationship with any of them for example. However, it doesn\u2019t actually cover sexual acts so you would still be fined in public if you do anything sexual with them inside a filled Mall for example. Furthermore, should they look \u2018non-human\u2019 like a Twi\u2019lek or have Cat ears this will also be hidden by their psychic effect.","Additionally, their psychic effect allows them empathy and to know what you\u2019re feeling and act accordingly. For example, to comfort you when you\u2019re feeling sad. In general, they strife to always support you. Whether that is relaxing after a long day at work or being a wing man/wing woman.","As mentioned, a Servus starts as a mere Spark of possible life but this Spark can take the form of a being designated to them by their Master. Just to get this cleared out. A Servus can only manifest and change their form ONCE. After this they will be in this form forever. This form can be whatever gender you prefer, be it female, male, or something different like nonbinary or a girl with male testicles to give two examples.","If you happen to make them become a \u2018fictional\u2019 character of some sort they will also become them in all personality, biological and all else, but any powers they have are not present. We sealed this aspect about them away to ensure there will be no actual wars due to them.","You can also choose to \u2018alter\u2019 some things about a character your Servus is supposed to take inspiration from. For example, an gender bent version of the original or some other slight alterations.","They have an interesting way of reproduction. Namely they can reproduce asexually and \u2018will\u2019 themselves into being pregnant. This pregnancy is independent of gender and even a male could birth another Servus. This will occur like a human pregnancy but will be guaranteed to be safe. They can give birth this way only once a year. They can however decide how long the pregnancy is, from a week to a full year. The timespan doesn\u2019t actually affect the growing Servus in any way. They will than birth one Servus Spark which will abide by all the same rules the other Servusi do.","They can also \u2018impregnate\u2019 someone if the receiving party consents. This will give them the same kind of \u2018Servus\u2019 pregnancy but the resulting child can be decided by the parent who gives the birth to be either the same species as them or a Servus as well. No hybrids are possible.","Servusi by nature possess divine essence as a creation of raw energy by their creator. However, they themselves are neither gods or mortals. They are more akin to demi-demigods in terms of how much divine power is present in them. This doesn\u2019t have any actual effect on you and really only explains the nature of their abilities. However, they ARE pretty popular by Gods who like being worshipped. We have a\u2026 let\u2019s say \u2018contract\u2019 with a certain city of Gods who steadily take some poor Servusi of our hands. Don\u2019t worry I can assure you every Servusi that leaves this market enjoys their existence.","PHEW! Okay that should be about everything in terms of Servusi characteristics. Sorry about that info dump. Now let\u2019s get into making them okay?"]},your_harem:{title:"Your Harem",description:["Libis snaps his fingers and several orbs of energy appear before you. They surround you like moths do a bright light and you can feel the excitement emitting from them.","While we have plenty of Servusi to go around, out of experience I can tell you that too many Waifu or Husbando can be a lot to deal with all at once. As such we made a certain \u2018limit\u2019. You get to choose any number from 1 to 10 Servus Sparks. This are the minimum and maximum number of Sparks you can receive so its ultimately up to you how big you want your Harem to be. These Sparks you will than form into your future Harem. Don\u2019t worry its easy trust me, and they will be happy as long as you are happy.","As stated, you can assign them any form you wish, be it after a fictional character, one you completely made up, or even a real character. In the latter case don\u2019t worry it will not be weird and their minor psychic influence will guarantee that two of the same looking people won\u2019t make it difficult in any way.","Choose up to 10 characters no matter what source they are from, for your Servusi to take the form of."]},wares:{title:"Wares",alwaysShowTitle:!0,description:["<i>One by one the Sparks flare up, pulsating with unleashed energy taking form.</i>","Alright great!
