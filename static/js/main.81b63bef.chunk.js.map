His clothing had been thrown away as he entered, seemingly being restrictive for him as leaned back into a pillow and turned his full attention to you.\",\n    \"Alright. Sorry for the haste just now but we would like to get this over with as quickly and smoothly as possible. Welcome to the Willing Slave Market! Now my name is…\",\n    \"…Wait… why are you looking so horrified? I said WILLING.\",\n    \"Ooookay give me a second I explain to you real quick what’s going on here.\",\n    \"See my name is Libis. I am a minor God of sexual desire. My colleagues are also divine entities of similar backgrounds. We all come from the same localized Verse and met up for companionship and to not be so alone in this vast Verse. What? Even Gods like companionship.\",\n    \"Well, what follows next is kinda a long story but to make it short, we happened to come across a God of Creation in our home universe. He was not much stronger than any of us, but he had plans of conquest and tried to create a species of super soldiers to serve as his lackeys in a siege on a Planet that refused to worship him. Now we decided to not let some asshat try and conquer a whole World that didn’t want to deal with his bullshit, pardon my language, so we went and teamed up on him and destroyed him. He wasn’t truly immortal, at least to not as strong degrees that he could come back, so that was one thing taken care of. However, while said deity is now dealt with… we still have their creation. Those were the ‘Servus’ or ‘Servusi’ in plural.\",\n    \"They are a literal semblance of potential life matter that is conscious, sentient and born with mature mentality. They don’t even look like anything alive yet, they are only orbs of light the size of a football.\",\n    \"They want nothing more than to serve. I mean they NEED to serve. Literally. They are an incredible submissive species that take great joy in following and obeying a Master. For them it is like a purpose of life. To be of use and enjoy the pleasure of servitude.\",\n    \"And we… kinda killed their Master. Oops.\",\n    \"At least we did that before the thousands of them could ‘imprint’ on him and see him as their Master. However, there is still the fact that we got a whole species with these kinds of desires and we felt obligated to help them out.\",\n    \"So, for now we have decided to make US their masters however this can’t really be a permanent solution. There is a practical infinite amount of them, as the thing that ‘births’ them is a raw hole in space time that spits out thousands of them per year. Let alone that this is still merely a non- permanent solution, and everyone knows that, them as well. There is no ‘personal’ connection.\",\n    \"So, in an infinite Multiverse how do you deal with what is basically the ideal willing slave race? Well simple. We let them fulfill their purpose.\",\n    \"This is how this project came to be. Welcome to the Willing Slave Market, or also the Servusi Market. We are an organization that decided to ensure these poor Slaves with no Master or Mistress to call their own get one by delivering them as servants to beings across the Multiverse. Be they Gods or mortals like you.\",\n    \"You and the other people from before were picked at random so congratulations!\",\n    \"Well, we DID consider other factors than random chance of course. Like overall mental state, if you have some good Karma to spend and so on. We’re not just giving them to some abusive asshole or serial killer or something. I actually choose you myself! You seemed like you could use some extra company and you deserved it in my book. But enough of the method of choosing…\",\n    \"So what do you say? Want to take some of them with you?\",\n    \"...\",\n    \"You do? OKAY!

They are unbreakably loyal and in love to them till the very end and give of a passive aura of love that makes their Master also feel happiness when doing something with them, but not in a way which makes the emotion lessen in long term. They want to be their Masters perfect Servant/Lover/etc. While the relationship between you and your Servusi is dependent on you no matter what form it takes they will be the perfect fit for it. For example: any and all kinks you happen to have are their own in a complimentary way. If you’re a Dom their a Sub, if you’re a Sub their a Dom and as a Switch their also Switches for example. This even counts for your actual sex drive, or lack thereof if you happen to be asexual.\",\n    \"By nature, Servusi don’t really have a concept of sexuality as mortals do. They simply love their Master and their fellow Servus. I guess you could call them pansexual but it wouldn’t quite fit. There will be in Harem relationships if you have no issue with that though you will always be their ‘nexus’ basically.\",\n    \"They aren’t completely immortal but have eternal youth, don’t need sustenance and are immune to disease as well as all having a healing factor strong enough to regenerate limbs in a day. Their mental and physical age is never younger than 18 years old, from the moment they pop into existence. They are soul bonded to their Master and will only die when you do. Should they die of violence for some reason they will ‘respawn’ after a day by taxing your Soul. Don’t worry your Soul will be fine and regenerate but you’ll feel tired for a few hours, proportional to however many Servusi revived. After YOU die, they will follow you into whatever afterlife you happen to go to.\",\n    \"They all have a passive psychic effect which works in your and their favour in terms of ‘acceptance’. What this means is that no one will mind it or find your relationship with them odd. Not any family members, friends, strangers, not even any romantic partners you happen to have. In fact, a romantic non Servus partner could be seen by them as a ‘second Master’ and they will strive to serve them as well. This field even works in terms of acceptance of sexuality, so if you are a guy and your Servusi Harem is filled with other guys even the most extreme homophobe wouldn’t bat an eye at your relationship with any of them for example. However, it doesn’t actually cover sexual acts so you would still be fined in public if you do anything sexual with them inside a filled Mall for example. Furthermore, should they look ‘non-human’ like a Twi’lek or have Cat ears this will also be hidden by their psychic effect.\",\n    \"Additionally, their psychic effect allows them empathy and to know what you’re feeling and act accordingly. For example, to comfort you when you’re feeling sad. In general, they strife to always support you. Whether that is relaxing after a long day at work or being a wing man/wing woman.\",\n    \"As mentioned, a Servus starts as a mere Spark of possible life but this Spark can take the form of a being designated to them by their Master. Just to get this cleared out. A Servus can only manifest and change their form ONCE. After this they will be in this form forever. This form can be whatever gender you prefer, be it female, male, or something different like nonbinary or a girl with male testicles to give two examples.\",\n    \"If you happen to make them become a ‘fictional’ character of some sort they will also become them in all personality, biological and all else, but any powers they have are not present. We sealed this aspect about them away to ensure there will be no actual wars due to them.\",\n    \"You can also choose to ‘alter’ some things about a character your Servus is supposed to take inspiration from. For example, an gender bent version of the original or some other slight alterations.\",\n    \"They have an interesting way of reproduction. Namely they can reproduce asexually and ‘will’ themselves into being pregnant. This pregnancy is independent of gender and even a male could birth another Servus. This will occur like a human pregnancy but will be guaranteed to be safe. They can give birth this way only once a year. They can however decide how long the pregnancy is, from a week to a full year. The timespan doesn’t actually affect the growing Servus in any way. They will than birth one Servus Spark which will abide by all the same rules the other Servusi do.\",\n    \"They can also ‘impregnate’ someone if the receiving party consents. This will give them the same kind of ‘Servus’ pregnancy but the resulting child can be decided by the parent who gives the birth to be either the same species as them or a Servus as well. No hybrids are possible.\",\n    \"Servusi by nature possess divine essence as a creation of raw energy by their creator. However, they themselves are neither gods or mortals. They are more akin to demi-demigods in terms of how much divine power is present in them. This doesn’t have any actual effect on you and really only explains the nature of their abilities. However, they ARE pretty popular by Gods who like being worshipped. We have a… let’s say ‘contract’ with a certain city of Gods who steadily take some poor Servusi of our hands. Don’t worry I can assure you every Servusi that leaves this market enjoys their existence.\",\n    \"PHEW! Okay that should be about everything in terms of Servusi characteristics.
